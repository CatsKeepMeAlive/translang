# Common Misunderstandings

## ni- vs mo- vs -fe

It seems that many don't understand the difference between these three, so let's show it on few examples:

Like if wusita is good, then 
* *ni*wusita, not good, other than good, is not really good but not necessarily bad;
* *mo*wusita, contrary to good, is bad; and
* wusita*fe*, in opposition to good, is evil.

And for opposite case it's is true too, if disita is bad, then:
* *ni*disita, not good bad, other than bad, is not really bad but not necessarily good;
* *mo*disita, contrary to bad, is good; and
* disita*fe*, in opposition to bad, is against bad.
