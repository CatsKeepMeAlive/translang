# Formatting

## Resources

* For a short markdown guide see [this](https://commonmark.org/help/). <br>
* For a more extensive markdown guide, see [this](https://handbook.gitlab.com/docs/markdown-guide/).

## Hard rules

* Formatting — both of the raw markdown code and the result of its visual rendering — should be as consistent as possible
* Every page should have a descriptive but concise title
* The title should be an \<h1> heading, that is, the line should be preceded by preceded by a `#`
* Sections, subsections, or n*(sub)sections should be \<h2> , \<h3> or \<hn> headings respectively. If you need more than the 6 default headings included in standard markdown, you're probably doing something wrong

## Soft rules/guidelines

### Regarding the raw markdown code

* Between every significant mass of characters (a paragraph of text, a table, an itemised list, an enumerated list, etc.) there should be one empty line
* HTML tags should be avoided unless imperative for the situation
